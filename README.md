# DriverMode (name subject to change)

The airplane mode for driving. This setting (starting in iOS) will allow drivers to disable certain incoming notifications that can serve as on-road distractions and much more.

Features to be implemented:
 - Turn off incoming notifications (Banners and Alerts) by switching all app alerts to "None" when the setting is enabled. Also toggle off "Show on Lock Screen" setting. 
 - Put settings near the Airplane Mode switch (if possible)
 - Choose exceptions for "emergency contacts"
 - If app is needed, have some kind of user interface in the app itself
 - Provides directions to nearby text/rest stops
 - Notify your friends that you are driving if you they contact you
